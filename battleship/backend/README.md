# capstone3750 (project backend repository)

## Project overview
A multiplayer web app Battleship game.
## Architecture summary
The [backend](https://github.com/SStamper-Dev/capstone3750) is PHP for managing the server's API endpoints. It connects to a MySQL database (on the same network) for storing player, ship, and game information. The [frontend](https://github.com/SStamper-Dev/warship) is HTML/CSS and JavaScript for handling user interaction and sending it to the server.
